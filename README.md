# Ansible Playbooks for Raspberry Pi

Some ansible configurations for the Raspberry Pi.

### Requirements:

### Getting started:

Edit the `inventory` file and updated with the IP of you Raspberry Pi.

#### Wifi Role

Change the `group_vars/all` file so you replace the variables with the information of your network

```

Then, execute the playbook.

#### Retropie Role
